# Getting the Real Stripe Toolshed Shim

## Current Situation:
- ‚úÖ **MCP configuration is working** (confirmed by Inspector)
- ‚úÖ **Test shim responds** correctly
- ‚ùå **Using test shim** instead of real Stripe toolshed shim
- ‚ùå **Need real shim** that proxies to production toolshed

## What You Need:
The **real Stripe toolshed_stdio_shim.sh** that:
- Proxies requests to production toolshed
- Provides actual SAIL tools
- Handles Stripe analytics queries

## Options to Get Real Shim:

### Option 1: Contact #toolshed-help üí¨ (Recommended)
Message in Slack:
```
Hi! I have the MCP setup working with a test shim, but I need the real 
toolshed_stdio_shim.sh that proxies to production toolshed.

I don't have VPN access to clone pay-server from git.corp.stripe.com.
Can someone share the real shim script or provide an alternative way 
to access it?

My MCP is configured and working, just need the production shim.
```

### Option 2: Ask a Colleague üë•
Ask someone on your team to:
1. Go to their `~/stripe/pay-server/.cursor/` directory
2. Share the `toolshed_stdio_shim.sh` file
3. Send it via Slack/email

### Option 3: Try Alternative Git Access üîÑ
Some possibilities:
- **Different git URL**: Ask if there's a public/external git URL
- **Archive download**: Ask if pay-server is available as ZIP download
- **Mirror repository**: Check if there's an external mirror

### Option 4: Alternative Toolshed Access üåê
Ask #toolshed-help about:
- **Direct HTTP endpoints** for SAIL
- **API keys** for toolshed access
- **Alternative MCP configurations** that don't need the shim

## Once You Get the Real Shim:

```bash
# Backup current test shim
cp ~/stripe/pay-server/.cursor/toolshed_stdio_shim.sh ~/stripe/pay-server/.cursor/toolshed_stdio_shim.sh.test

# Replace with real shim (however you received it)
# Make sure it's executable
chmod +x ~/stripe/pay-server/.cursor/toolshed_stdio_shim.sh

# Test it
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}' | ~/stripe/pay-server/.cursor/toolshed_stdio_shim.sh cursor

# Restart Cursor to pick up the new shim
```

## Expected Difference:
- **Test shim**: Shows "sail_test" tool with test response
- **Real shim**: Shows actual SAIL tools for Stripe analytics

## Your Setup is Ready! üéâ
Everything is configured correctly - you just need to swap the test shim for the real one.

**Recommendation: Start with #toolshed-help - they'll know the quickest way to get you the real shim.**
