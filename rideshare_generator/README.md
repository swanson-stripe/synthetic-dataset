# RideShare Plus Synthetic Stripe Data Generator

A comprehensive Python script that generates realistic on-demand transportation platform data with drivers, dynamic pricing, fraud patterns, and complete Stripe Connect/Issuing integration over a 24-month business lifecycle.

## üöó Overview

RideShare Plus simulates a full-scale rideshare platform with realistic transportation industry patterns including:

- **Stripe Connect Express accounts** for driver onboarding and payouts
- **Dynamic surge pricing** based on time patterns and demand
- **Stripe Issuing cards** for driver fuel and expense management
- **Fraud detection scenarios** with ML-style pattern recognition
- **Multi-city expansion** across 25 major US markets
- **Complete ride lifecycle** from request to payout

## üìä Business Model Simulation

### **Platform Economics**
- **Base fare**: $2.50 + $1.50/mile + $0.35/minute
- **Driver take rate**: 75% of fare
- **Platform fee**: 25% of fare + $1.99 booking fee
- **Instant payout fee**: $0.50 for immediate transfers
- **Airport surcharge**: $3.50 for airport pickups/dropoffs

### **Vehicle Types**
- **RideShare Standard**: 4 passengers, 1.0x pricing (70% of rides)
- **RideShare Premium**: 4 passengers, 1.5x pricing (20% of rides)
- **RideShare XL**: 6 passengers, 1.8x pricing (10% of rides)

### **Lifecycle Stages**
- **Early (Months 1-8)**: 50 drivers, 150 rides/week, 1 city
- **Growth (Months 9-16)**: 150 drivers, 600 rides/week, 3 cities
- **Mature (Months 17-24)**: 300 drivers, 1,200 rides/week, 5 cities

### **Dynamic Pricing Patterns**
- **Rush hour surge**: 7-9 AM (1.5x), 5-7 PM (1.8x)
- **Late night**: 11 PM-2 AM (1.3x boost)
- **Weekend nights**: Friday/Saturday 10 PM-2 AM (2.0x boost)
- **Airport surge**: Additional 1.4x multiplier for airport rides
