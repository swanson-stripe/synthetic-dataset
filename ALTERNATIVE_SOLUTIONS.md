# üö® No VPN Access - Alternative Solutions for SAIL MCP

## Current Situation:
- ‚ùå **No VPN available** to access git.corp.stripe.com
- ‚ùå **SSH and HTTPS clone both fail** (timeout on port 22222)
- ‚úÖ **MCP configuration is ready** and waiting for the shim script

## Alternative Solutions:

### Option 1: Get Shim Script from Colleague üë•
**Contact #toolshed-help or a colleague** and ask them to share the file:
```
~/stripe/pay-server/.cursor/toolshed_stdio_shim.sh
```

**Once you get the file:**
1. Create the directory: `mkdir -p ~/stripe/pay-server/.cursor/`
2. Place the script: `~/stripe/pay-server/.cursor/toolshed_stdio_shim.sh`
3. Make it executable: `chmod +x ~/stripe/pay-server/.cursor/toolshed_stdio_shim.sh`
4. Run verification: `cd ~/dash2 && ./get-pay-server.sh`
5. Restart Cursor

### Option 2: Contact #toolshed-help üí¨
Ask in the #toolshed-help Slack channel:
```
Hi! I'm trying to set up the SAIL MCP tool in Cursor but don't have VPN access to clone pay-server. 

Can someone help me get the toolshed_stdio_shim.sh script or provide an alternative way to access SAIL via MCP?

My MCP config is already set up to use: ~/stripe/pay-server/.cursor/toolshed_stdio_shim.sh

Thanks!
```

### Option 3: Check for Alternative Access Methods üîç
Ask #toolshed-help if there are:
- **Public endpoints** for the SAIL MCP tool
- **Alternative shim scripts** that don't require VPN
- **Different MCP server configurations** for external access

### Option 4: Manual Setup (If You Get the Script)
If someone shares the script with you:

```bash
# Create directory structure
mkdir -p ~/stripe/pay-server/.cursor/

# Place the script (however you received it)
# Make it executable
chmod +x ~/stripe/pay-server/.cursor/toolshed_stdio_shim.sh

# Test it works
~/stripe/pay-server/.cursor/toolshed_stdio_shim.sh --help

# Run verification
cd ~/dash2
./get-pay-server.sh

# Restart Cursor
```

## What's Already Done ‚úÖ
- **MCP configuration**: Correctly set up in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Directory structure**: `~/stripe/` created
- **SSH key**: Generated and configured (for future use)
- **Scripts ready**: Verification and setup scripts prepared

## Estimated Timeline:
- **Option 1 (colleague)**: 5-10 minutes
- **Option 2 (#toolshed-help)**: 10-30 minutes  
- **Option 3 (alternative)**: Variable

## Next Steps:
1. **Contact #toolshed-help** or a colleague
2. **Request the shim script** or alternative access method
3. **Follow setup once you have the file**

## The Good News üéâ
Everything is configured correctly - you just need that one script file to complete the setup!

**Recommendation: Start with #toolshed-help - they'll know the best approach for your situation.**
